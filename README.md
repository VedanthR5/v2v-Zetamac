V2V Zetamac Buffed is a web-based arithmetic game inspired by the classic Zetamac speed drill. While the original is excellent for raw practice, it lacks feedback for targeted improvement. This version "buffs" the experience by adding a comprehensive post-game analysis dashboard to help you identify and work on your specific weaknesses.

---

## Why This App?

The goal of mental math practice is to get faster and more accurate. However, improvement requires understanding where you're struggling. The original Zetamac shows you a final score but leaves you wondering:

- **Which specific questions took me the longest?**
- **Am I weaker at multiplication or division?**
- **What specific numbers or factors are slowing me down?**

This app was built to answer those questions. It logs every correct answer, tracking the time taken and attempts, then presents it all in a clear, actionable report.

---

## Core Features

- **Classic Timed Drill:** A fast-paced arithmetic game with customizable operations, number ranges, and duration.
- **Detailed Analysis Dashboard:** After each session, view a full report of your performance.
- **Per-Question Breakdown:** See exactly how long you spent on each problem.
- **Performance Summary:** Automatically identifies your slowest category (e.g., multiplication) to highlight your weakest area.
- **Shareable Settings:** Game settings are encoded in the URL, making it easy to share your custom configurations.
- **Customizable Ranges:** Adjust the difficulty for each operation type independently.

## How to Use

1. **Configure Your Game:**

   - Select which operations you want to practice (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
   - Adjust the number ranges for each operation type
   - Choose your game duration (30 seconds to 10 minutes)

2. **Start Playing:**

   - Click "Start" to begin the timed drill
   - Type your answers and press Enter (or just keep typing - correct answers auto-submit!)
   - Watch your score and remaining time at the top

3. **Review Your Performance:**

   - After time runs out, view your comprehensive analysis
   - See which questions took the longest
   - Identify your weakest operation category
   - Review every problem you solved with timing data

4. **Share Your Settings:**
   - Notice the URL changes when you start a game
   - Copy and share that URL to challenge friends with the same settings!
